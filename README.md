# Futoshiki-Solver
This project implements the Backtracking Algorithm for Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) to solve 5 × 5 Futoshiki puzzles. The goal is to find assignments (1 to 5) for the empty cells on a 5 × 5 game board such that the inequality relationships between adjacent cells are satisfied. In addition, a digit can only appear once in every row and column.

# Rules
- The game board consists of 5 × 5 cells. Some of the cells already have numbers (1 to 5) assigned to them.

- Inequality signs (< or >) are placed horizontally or vertically between some of the adjacent cells.

- The goal is to find assignments (1 to 5) for the empty cells such that the inequality relationships between adjacent cells are satisfied.

- A digit can only appear once in every row and column.
